## Getting Started

Running the frontend locally requires the installation of [Node.js (Version 10+)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

To run the project, [fulfill all prerequisites](readme.md#prerequisites) and `cd` into the `/frontend` folder.

Create a [`.env` file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49579028/adding-an-env-file-to-a-react-project), at root-level, containing the requisite environment variables mentioned [above](readme.md#environment-variables).

Subsequently, install dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

The frontend can be started locally using:

```bash
npm start
```

## Prerequisites
